Other test subjects: 

username: `tester`, password: `testUser1`

username: `tester2`, password: `testUser2`

## Things to imporve
Due to time limit, I can only implement the basic functionalities. However, I can improve it much better if more time allowed.
1. Hash the password and when login, store the window seesion token so no need to login again when page refreshes.
2. Seperate the style into css file and change UI.
3. Add more features such as registering new users, editing questions etc. These should be easy based on current project structure.
4. Add unit tests.
